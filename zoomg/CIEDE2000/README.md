CIE Delta E 2000 (CIEDE2000)
----------------------------

A C++ library containing a function to determine how similar two colors are.
The code here is original, based on the psuedocode written in the paper
[The CIEDE2000 Color-Difference Formula: Implementation Notes, Supplementary
Test Data, and Mathematical Observations](http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~gsharma/ciede2000/), by Gaurav Sharma, Wencheng Wu, and Edul N. Dalal. While
this is written in C++ so that I could place it in a namespace, there's nothing
C++-specific about the implementation, and so it would be trivial to convert
to C if required. The conversion is left as an exercise to the reader.

**To Build**
`make`

**To Test**
`make test && ./testCIEDE2000` (Expected output below.)

As I implemented the method from the paper, I commented the code to line up
code fragements with lines from the paper for tracability. There are ways to
speed up and optimize this algorithm, which have not been attempted.

A test program (`testCIEDE2000`) is built by default to run the
[tests](http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~gsharma/ciede2000/dataNprograms/CIEDE2000.xls) perscribed by the algorithm authors. Tested on OS X 10.10.2,
and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Should work on Cygwin/MINGW, though there will likely
need to be edits to the [Makefile](Makefile).

**NOTE**
The `CIEDE2000` algorithm uses colors from the 
[LAB colorspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space), not RGB. In
practice, I've used [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) to convert 
color values for use with CIEDE2000, though that not may be entirely correct.
